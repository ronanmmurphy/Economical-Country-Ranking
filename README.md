# Economical-Country-Ranking
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an intergovernmental economic organisation with 36 member countries, founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It publishes results on several important economic and societal measures of its member states. In December 2019, it published the 2018 PISA results (Programme for International Student Assessment) which reviews every three years the performance of 15-year old students in terms of literacy, mathematics and science. The graphic shown above shows the comparative ranking of students across all OECD member states.
