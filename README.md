# Economical-Country-Ranking
Data Visualisation project coded in R. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an intergovernmental economic organisation with 36 member countries, founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It publishes results on several important economic and societal measures of its member states. In December 2019, it published the 2018 PISA results (Programme for International Student Assessment) which reviews every three years the performance of 15-year old students in terms of literacy, mathematics and science. 

The graphic shown below shows the comparative ranking of students across all OECD member states.

The second plot compares the Reading values over the time period which the exam was taken in each country. A subset of countries was chosen to represent the top 5 GDP countries in Europe as you would expect these scores to be the highest overall, and to compare these overtime. The countries were France, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, and Germany. A faceted grouped bar plot is used to compare the different countries over the time series as it is the easiest method to visually analyse. I discuss below each section of creating the plot and design decisions. The theme of the plot matches the previous with the background, text and gridlines kept the same colours. As all the values are above 450 a zoomed plot of the top makes is easier to compare each year.
